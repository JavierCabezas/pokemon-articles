            <h1>My nerdy pokémon articles</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Javier and I'm a software engineer. Since I was (and currently still am, to be honest)
                a huge nerd and lived as a kid in the 90s it's quite expected for me to get interested in pokémon,
                specially red and blue.

                These games have a huge place in my heart. I loved the rumors and glitches around those games.
                They were kind of magical in their own way, specially Missigno. So, when I grew up, I decided to
                try to understand the mechanics of that what made my childhood so special.

                So my intention in this little webpage is to share a little knowledge that I researched a couple
                of years ago, while I was studying computer science at college.
